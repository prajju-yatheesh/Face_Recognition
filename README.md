<h3>ðŸ“Œ Project Overview</h3>

<p>
  This repository showcases a <strong>Smart Face Recognition System</strong>, developed as part of a 
  <strong>mini-project at our college</strong>. The goal is to identify individuals in real-time using 
  <strong>deep learning</strong> techniques.
</p>

<p>
  A webcam is used to capture face images, and the system employs <strong>MobileFaceNet</strong> for 
  lightweight facial feature extraction along with the <strong>ArcFace loss function</strong> to enhance recognition accuracy. 
  Real-time identity matching is performed using <strong>cosine similarity</strong> between live and stored embeddings.
</p>

<p>
  The entire system â€” including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and live inference â€” was built and tested 
  on a laptop using <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>OpenCV</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  As part of our upcoming <strong>major project</strong>, we plan to deploy this system on the 
  <strong>Xilinx Kria KV260 FPGA board</strong> to achieve <strong>low-latency</strong> and 
  <strong>energy-efficient</strong> processing for real-world surveillance applications.
